# Pokemon Visualization and Prediction
The data set was found in a Kaggle repository and includes all stats associated with every Pokemon listed, as well as a separate data sheet listing all outcomes of Pokemon battles recorded in the TV show. I used this to determine if there was a noticable pattern to which Pokemon are more likely to win in battles, therefore allowing the user to develop the best team possible using existing Pokemon and to include any other Pokemon that are created in the future.

# Algorithms Used
Although Clustering was first attempted, I instead chose to use Random Forest Classification, Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN Classification.  I also used K-Fold Cross Validation to test how rigorous all these models were in an attempt to measure the robustness of the obtained results.

# Results Obtained
The best accuracy obtained was using Linear SVM at 96.56%.
